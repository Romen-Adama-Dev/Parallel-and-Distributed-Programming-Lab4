Dear professor,
I am writing you this txt to tell you that the last exercise, despite having understood how the omp directive works,
I think I am having a failure with the matrix. I think that with my code the matrix is being overloaded,
but I don't understand how to clean the matrix.
Sorry for any inconvenience, but we have tons of deliveries each week and I haven't been able to dedicate
enough time to complete that task.
A cordial greeting,
Romen Adama Caetano Ramirez
